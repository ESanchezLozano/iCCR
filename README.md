# iCCR -> Incremental Cascaded Continuous Regression.
# IMPORTANT: USAGE IS AS FOLLOWS

1) Download and unrar the model, from: 
https://uniofnottm-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/enrique_sanchezlozano_nottingham_ac_uk/EZJmYC5b2IJErTYFIR3IqKcBhdyURabHTpv-KINsjBny_w?e=N5vDBq

2) In Matlab, load model.mat

  2.1) model.mat contains the following variables: "model" and "params". 

3) Define video = 'path_to_video.format' to process an existing video, or video = [] to process a webcam stream

4) Call track(model, video, params);

Example:

load model.mat
video = [];
data = track(model, video, params); % - data will store the tracked points for the processed video

- Should you want to detect the points in single images (i.e. without applying the tracking step), you can proceed as follows:

pts = detect_pts_SDM( im , model ); % - where im is the target image

- You can also refine the points applying a tracking step on the given points:

pts = ccr_track( im , pts , model );

Important: Code is released as is for research purposes only. 

CCR models have been trained using the LFPW, HELEN, AFW, IBUG, Multi-PIE and 300VW (training partition) datasets. 

Should you use the code as is, please cite [1] and [2]. The (bounding box) face detection utilises the DLIB library, and has been compiled only in Windows, and therefore is not yet available for Mac or Linux. Instead, the built-in Viola-Jones-based face detection system is used, which may result in a drop of performance.
